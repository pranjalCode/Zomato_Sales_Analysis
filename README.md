It explores sales data for Zomato, a popular online food delivery platform, using various Power BI functionalities to deliver insights into customer buying behavior and sales trends.


## Project Overview

Zomato, as a leading player in the online food delivery market, generates vast amounts of data regarding customer orders, preferences, and trends. This project utilizes Power BI to analyze this data and extract actionable insights for business decision-making.

Project Highlights
### 1. DAX Functions

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions are utilized extensively throughout the project to perform calculations and create custom measures. Some of the key DAX functions employed in this project include:

- **CALCULATE**: Used to evaluate an expression in a context modified by filters.
- **SUMX**: Iterates over each row of a table and calculates an expression.
- **VAR**: Defines a variable and assigns a value to it.
- **DISTINCTCOUNT**: Calculates the count of distinct values in a column.

These DAX functions enable the creation of complex measures and calculations, allowing for deeper analysis of the Zomato sales data.
### 2. Interactive Visualizations

The Power BI reports in this project feature interactive visualizations designed to provide users with a dynamic and intuitive exploration experience. Various types of visualizations, including bar charts, line charts, pie charts, buttons, and cards, are utilized to present key insights and trends in the Zomato sales data.
